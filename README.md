# sudofox/hatena-locales

Some tools to try to make Hatena sites (mostly Hatena Blog) more usable.

It's my hope that I can package up localizations in a way that's easy for Hatena to import.

A few times over the years, I've written in asking if they'd be willing to let me submit localization updates, but I generally get turned down with the justification that they are no longer targeting an international audience.

But to heck with it, I'll do it anyway.
